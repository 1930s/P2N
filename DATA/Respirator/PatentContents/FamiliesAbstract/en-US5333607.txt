A ventilator manifold is disclosed which includes a port for attachment and detachment of an accessory device thereto without interruption of continuous respiratory support of the patient. A particular embodiment of an accessory device described herein includes a suctioning device for removal of fluids from a patient's lungs during respiratory support. The manifold includes an accessory access port which has a normally closed valve therein which remains closed regardless of the pressure changes within the manifold. The normally closed valve is positioned in the port such that placement of a specially designed adaptor therein located on the suctioning device forces the normally closed valve to an open position, thus allowing passage of a suction catheter through the manifold into the patient. Removal of the adaptor of the suctioning device allows the normally closed valve to return to its closed position, thus allowing continued operation of the respiratory system even when no accessory device is present in the accessory device access port. The adaptor includes a housing which is specially adapted to be securable within the valve in the access port of the manifold so as to substantially inhibit pressure loss from the manifold while simultaneously forcing the valve to an open position. The manifold and valve are adapted to allow cleaning and lavage therethrough without detachment thereof.
