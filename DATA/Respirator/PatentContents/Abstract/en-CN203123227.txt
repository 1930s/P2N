The utility model belongs to the technical field of medical equipment, and discloses a respirator with a sputum excretion function. A respiration port is shared by a respiration loop and a sputum excretion loop. Pipelines communicated with lungs of a human body are divided into two branch paths, one branch path is in series connection with a reversing valve A (2) and is communicated with a respirator controller (1), the other branch path is in series connection with a reversing valve B (6) and is connected with an air tank (5), an inlet of the air tank (5) is connected with a vacuum pump (4), and the air tank (5) is connected with a pressure sensor (3). Therefore, the respirator with the sputum excretion function achieves a function of assisting respiration of the human body, and meanwhile helps a patient to exhaust sputum in the lungs of the patient.
