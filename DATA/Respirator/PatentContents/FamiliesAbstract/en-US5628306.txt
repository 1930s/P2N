A ventilator manifold is disclosed which includes a port for attachment and detachment of an accessory device thereto without interruption of continuous respiratory support of the patient. A particular embodiment of an accessory device described herein includes a suctioning device for removal of fluids from a patient's lungs during respiratory support. The manifold includes an accessory access port which has a normally closed valve therein which remains closed regardless of the pressure changes within the manifold. The normally closed valve is positioned in the port such that insertion of an accessory device adaptor therein forces the normally closed valve to an open position. Removal of the adaptor of the accessory device allows the normally closed valve to return to its closed position, thus allowing continued operation of the respiratory system even when no accessory device is present in the accessory device access port.
