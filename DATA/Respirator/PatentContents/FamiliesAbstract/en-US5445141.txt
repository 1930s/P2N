The invention relates to a respiratory support system (10) which includes a suction catheter device (41), a suction control valve (36), and a ventilator manifold (11). The ventilator (11) includes an access port (15) for attachment and detachment of the suction catheter device (41) thereto without interruption of continuous respiratory support of the patient. The access port (15) has a normally closed valve (16) therein which remains closed regardless of the pressure changes within the manifold (11). The normally closed valve (16) is positioned in the port (15) such that placement of a specially designed connector (40) of the suctioning device (41) therein forces the normally closed valve (16) to an open position, The manifold (11) and valve (16) are adapted to allow cleaning of the catheter (54) therethrough without detachment thereof.
