The invention relates to a suction catheter device usable with a respiratory support system which includes a catheter enveloped in a sleeve having a proximal end connector for connection to a suction source through a suction control device such as a suction control valve, and a distal end connector for attachment to a manifold of the respiratory support system. The proximal end connector includes a normally closed valve therein which prevents air flow through the catheter until a suction control device is attached thereto. The proximal end connector may also be adapted for use on a dual lumen catheter and thereby include a fluid injection passage having a one-way check valve therein. The distal end connector of the suction catheter device includes a magnifying window through which a portion of the catheter within the connector can be viewed. The catheter includes one or more markings thereon which indicate the relative position of the catheter and the connector, and which can be viewed through the magnifying window of the connector to indicate to the medical worker how far the catheter has been inserted into the patient's trachea or lungs. The invention also includes the method of assembly of the suction catheter device and the method of use thereof in conjunction with the respiratory support system.
