The lens is centred with respect to its axis of rotation with the spindles by way of a retractable sleeve 35 coaxial with the spindle 12, the centred lens being supported on member 42 freely rotatable on an extension 41 of the spindle 17 the member 42 carrying a support pad 45 having a contour corresponding to that of the lens. The lens may be provided with an annular rim to promote some initial rigidity to permit accurate alignment and locating of the lens, the rim being subsequently removed by a cutting tool, prior to the machining of the contour on the edge of the lens. Optical means may be provided to ensure accurate location of the lens on the axis of rotation prior to machining, the optical system being along the axis of the spindles which may be hollow. In an alternative embodiment an additional device is provided whereby the lens is "centred" by way of the above optical means and is cut to the appropriate diameter by an annular cutter 70 which is pivotable by way of a cranked arm 72 into and out of the machining axis so that machining of the contour of the lens edge can be effected as described when the annular cutter is positioned away from the spindle axis.

1372816 Grinding lenses ESSILOR INTERNATIONAL CIE GENERALE D'OPTIQUE 18 May 1973 18 May 1972 23870/73 Heading B3D A method of working the peripheral portion 14 of a flexible contact lens 10 comprises gripping the lens between a pair of coaxial rotary spindles 11, 12, rotating the spindles, and bring- ing a working surface 16 into contact with the lens until there is deformation of the peripheral portion of the blank whereby the opposed faces A, B of the lens are alternately worked. When moulded, the lens initially has an angular edge 13 which it is desired to machine to a rounded configuration. The lens is mounted between the spindles 11, 12, one of which is driven, and an abrasive surface 16 on a support 15 is arranged so that a normal N to the surface lies in the median of the plane of the periphery of the lens and the support is moved in a direction D parallel to the normal until the peripheral position of the lens deforms. During rotation of the lens, the deformation alternately reverses itself, as shown in Fig. 3, to round the edge of the lens. The method is repeated using finer abrasive and polishing is effected using a surface of pitch and pulverulent abrasive material.

PURPOSE:To make it possible to positive-negative symmetric coil current only by a unipolar electric power source by switching alternate terminals at both sides of a series circuit of a driving coil and capacitor from a positive potential to zero. CONSTITUTION:With switches S5 and S4 closed, capacitor C is charged and capacitor voltage Vc and coil voltage Vs1 of the switch S1 side increase from zero to +Vo. After initial charging, switches S5 and S4 are opened while switches S2 and S3 are closed. As a result, voltage Vs2 at the coupling point between switches S3 and S4 changes to +V1 and voltage Vs1 drops to OV; and voltage Vc increases to +(V0+V1) and Vc loses V1 due to a revolution loss to reach -V0 a half period later. For the purpose, switches S2 and S3 are opened and S1 and S4 are closed a half period later to set voltage Vs2 to OV and Vs1 to +V1 and consequently, voltage Vc changes to -(Vo+V1) and then approximates to +Vo a half cycle later. As a result, voltage Vc-Vs1 applied to driving coil L has the same waveform with voltage Vc at any time, so that it will be symmetrical between the positive and negative.

PURPOSE: To obtain excellent visual comfortableness whatever the diopter entry value of a lens is by constituting the surface of the lens of an area for far sight, an area for middle sight, and an area for near sight and determining the curvature of the principal meridian by a specific variance rule. CONSTITUTION: A surface S of a lens L consists of a visual field area VL for far sight, a visual field area VI for middle sight, and a visual field area VP for near sight. The curvature of the area VI is increased upward along a principal meridional curve MP. A curve C1 as the boundary between areas VI and VP crosses the curve MP at a point A2. Similarly, a curve C2 as the boundary between areas VI and VP crosses the curve MP at a point A2.; The curvature of the curve MP starts changing at a point A3, which is a distance d1=f(A) off the point A2, in the area VI and is changed in the same direction up to a point A4, which is a distance d2=h(A) off the point A2, also in the area VP. The difference between curvatures at points A2 and A4 is denoted as -C=g(A). These functions f(A), h(A), and g(A) are reduction functions of a diopter entry value A of the lens between points A1 and A2.

A method for machining contact lenses of flexible material such as silicone. The lens is centered on two rotary spindles of which one is a driving spindle and is clamped therebetween. An annular supporting member having a surface with the same curvature as the face of the lens maintains the shape of the flexible lens during rotation of the lens until it is hardened by the spraying of a jet of cooling fluid which may be liquid nitrogen or liquid air. The spraying of the lens continues while the diameter is reduced, if such reduction is necessary. The supporting member is then removed and the peripheral edge of the lens is machined.

A method for machining the peripheral portion of flexible contact lenses. A flexible contact lens blank is gripped between a pair of aligned rotary spindles which are then set in rotation. The actual machining is effected by a working surface which is preferably planar and covered with an abrasive material corresponding to the type of working treatment the contact lens blank is to undergo. The working surface is brought into contact with the angular peripheral edge of the lens blank until there is deformation of the peripheral portion of the lens blank. By holding the working surface in position relative to the lens blank being worked, the faces of the blank at the periphery are automatically alternately and successively worked.
