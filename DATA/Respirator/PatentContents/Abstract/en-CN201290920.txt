The utility model relates to a respiration alternation controller of a sputum suction upper breathing machine, which belongs to the technical field of medical instruments and devices. Medical personnel in hospitals may need to suction sputum when using the breathing machine to help the patients to breathe; the prior equipment is singly and separately operated, which affects the treatment efficiency, and brings trouble to the medical personnel. The technical proposal is as follows: a first switch (1) is arranged on a breathing machine connecting branch pipe (3); a second switch (2) is arranged on a sputum connecting branch pipe (4); an intubation head (6) is fixedly connected and communicated with a common main pipe (5); and the breathing machine connecting branch pipe (3), the sputum connecting branch pipe (4) and the common main pipe (5) are fixedly connected and communicated. The respiration alternation controller has the advantages of reasonable structure, creative and novel design, great improvement of the operation efficiency in treatment, and simple and convenient operation of the medical personnel.
