PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a suction catheter apparatus in which without spoiling the integrity of the internal pressure of a manifold, an ordinarily closed valve placed in the manifold port of a breathing protection apparatus and a suction control valve can be exchangeably detached from and attached to one end and the other end, respectively. ;SOLUTION: A catheter 54 having a base end and a tip 63 is provided. A tip connecting means 40, which is attached to the catheter 54 in a slidable way and connects the catheter apparatus 41 to the aeration means 11 of a breathing protection system 10, and a base end connecting means 72, which is fixed to the base end of the catheter 54 and connects the suction catheter apparatus 41 to a suction control means 79, are provided. A means 75 is provided, which prevents a fluid flow from passing through the catheter 54 when the base end connecting means 72 is not attached to the suction control means 79 and allows the fluid flow to pass through the catheter 54 when the base end connecting means 72 is attached to the suction control means 79. ;COPYRIGHT: (C)2004,JPO
