Fig 1 snows a three dimensional view c,f the Manual Lung Pump, sallowing the bellows with its face mask attached by tube. Fig 1.1 is a pivot. Fig 1. 2 is a hole for =:rr input or emission from the bellows.
When the Air inlet Hi r release disc i:not is at Off:, then the hole. is opened to -ts mia::imum eaten. When the air inlet air release disc is rot ateo to the PRTTAI,LV CLOSED position via its knob then there is a hole given by circle Fig 1.3. The air inlet air release disc can be rotated his its knob to the TOTALLY CLOSED position then no air can enter or 1eariTe the bellows. Fig 1.4 is the face mask terminal of the bellows, a threaded protrusion of the bellows to which the connector of the tube of the face mask attaches. Fig 1.5 is the cover of the face mask terminal of the bellows. Fig 1.6 is the tube terminal of the face mask to which the tube connector attaches. Fig 1.7 is the face mask. Fig 1.S is the mouth piece of the race mask. Fig 1.5 is the oxygen tank terminal of the bellows to which the tube of the oxygen tank attaches. Fig 1.10 is the cover of the oxygen tank terminal of the bellows. Fig 1.11 is the: valve which produces extra suction, it will emit airfCO? but not allow air in.
