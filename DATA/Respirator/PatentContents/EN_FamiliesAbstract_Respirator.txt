2134123 9321981 PCTABScor01 The invention relates to a respiratory support system (10) which includes a suction catheter device (41), a suction control valve (79), and a ventilator manifold (11). The catheter device (41) includes a proximal end connector (72) having a valve (75) therein which prevents air flow through the catheter (54) until the suction control valve (79) is attached thereto, and a distal end connector (40). The suction control valve (79) includes an actuator (113) which is linearly movable between a first position to a second position. The valve also includes a rotatable valve core (135) which can be rotated by the actuator (113) to a third position to disable its linear movement and to open an ancillary access port.; When the actuator (113) is in the first position, atmospheric air can pass through the valve (79) and into the suction pressure source in such a manner that a "hissing" auditory signal is generated, indicative of the presence of suction pressure within the valve (79). The ventilator (11) includes an access port (15) for attachment and detachment of the suction catheter device (41) thereto. The access port (15) has a normally closed valve (16) therein. The placement of the specially designed connector (40) of the suctioning device (41) in the access port (15) forcesthe normally closed valve (16) to an open position.

The invention discloses a medical instrument which can replace mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration. The manual respirator comprises a rod, one end of the rod is provided with a plug, the plug slides in a bin, the other end of the rod is welded on a handle; a slice of an actuator is also welded on the handle and parallel to the rod (bin), a shaft in a cylindrical chamber is driven to rotate by the lower end of the slice, the plug moves from one end to the other end for inhaling air into the bin, the shaft closes an inlet valve and opens an air outlet, the plug returns back, the air is pressed into the lungs of the injured through a hose and a mouth-supporting mask covered on the nose and mouth, the plug moves towards the other end, the air is inhaled back into the bin, the shaft rotates again, the air is discharged out of the bin, so that the respiration is realized by the repeated operation ; if the shaft rotates first, i.e. the inlet valve is closed, and the air outlet is opened, the plug moves from one end to the other end again, and the foreign body blocked in the throat can be sucked out through the negative pressure in the bin. The manual respirator has the advantages of small size, low price and convenient carrying and promotion.

The manifold of the respiration system includes an accessory access port which has a normally closed valve therein which remains closed regardless of the pressure changes within the manifold. However, the normally closed valve is positioned in the port such that placement of a specially designed male adaptor located on the suctioning device forces the normally closed valve to an open position, thus allowing passage of a suction catheter through the manifold into the patient. Removal of the male adaptor of the suctioning device allows the normally closed valve to return to its closed position, thus allowing continued operation of the respirator even when no accessory device is present in the accessory device access port. The male adaptor includes a housing which is specially adapted to be securable within the valve in the access port of the manifold so as to substantially inhibit pressure loss from the manifold while simultaneously forcing the valve to an open position.
