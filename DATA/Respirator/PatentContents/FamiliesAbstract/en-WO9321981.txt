The invention relates to a respiratory support system (10) which includes a suction catheter device (41), a suction control valve (79), and a ventilator manifold (11). The catheter device (41) includes a proximal end connector (72) having a valve (75) therein which prevents air flow through the catheter (54) until the suction control valve (79) is attached thereto, and a distal end connector (40). The suction control valve (79) includes an actuator (113) which is linearly movable between a first position to a second position. The valve also includes a rotatable valve core (135) which can be rotated by the actuator (113) to a third position to disable its linear movement and to open an ancillary access port.; When the actuator (113) is in the first position, atmospheric air can pass through the valve (79) and into the suction pressure source in such a manner that a "hissing" auditory signal is generated, indicative of the presence of suction pressure within the valve (79). The ventilator (11) includes an access port (15) for attachment and detachment of the suction catheter device (41) thereto. The access port (15) has a normally closed valve (16) therein. The placement of the specially designed connector (40) of the suctioning device (41) in the access port (15) forces the normally closed valve (16) to an open position.
