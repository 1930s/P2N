PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED: To provide a method by which a respiratory support system such as a suction catheter can be attached and detached to a respiratory support system via an adapter without disturbing continuous respiratory support for a patient. ;SOLUTION: The respiratory support system comprises a manifold 11 with an attachment access port 15 including a normally closed valve 16 therein, and an engagement mechanism 44. An adapter 43 is inserted into the attachment access port 15 of the manifold 11. As the adapter 43 is inserted into the attachment access port 15, the normally closed valve 16 in the attachment access port 15 is forcibly opened by the adapter 43 and the adapter 43 is engaged with the manifold 11 by operating the engagement mechanism 44 for allowing the adapter 43 to be engaged in a single relative orientation to the manifold 11. ;COPYRIGHT: (C)2007,JPO&INPIT
