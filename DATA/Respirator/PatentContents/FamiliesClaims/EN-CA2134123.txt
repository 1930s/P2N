1. A respiratory support system comprising: a ventilator manifold adapted to be connected for fluid flow attachment between a patient and a ventilator circuit, a sleeved suction catheter device including a catheter, a distal end connector and a proximal end connector, and a suction control valve; said distal end connector being adapted for connection with said ventilator manifold and said proximal end connector being adapted for connection with said suction control valve, and a normally closed catheter valve in said proximal end connector of said sleeved catheter device, said normally closed catheter valve being operative between a normally closed sealing position and an open operative position, said normally closed catheter valve preventing fluid flow through said catheter in said closed sealing position and allowing fluid flow through said catheter in said open operative position, means responsive to attachment of said suction control valve to said proximal end connector to move said normally closed catheter valve from said sealing position to said open operative position.
2. A respiratory support system according to claim 1 wherein said ventilator manifold further includes an accessory access port for allowing attachment of said distal end connector of said sleeved catheter device to said ventilator manifold, said accessory access port being normally closed against fluid flow therethrough,   whereby attachment of said distal end connector of said sleeved catheter device to said accessory access port operates to open said accessory access port to allow fluid flow access between said ventilator manifold and said catheter.
3. A respiratory support system according to claim 2 wherein said accessory access port includes a normally closed access port valve therein said normally closed access port valve being operative between a normally closed sealing position and an open operative position, whereby, said normally closed access port valve is forced from said normally closed sealing position to said open operative position by said distal end connector to allow fluid flow through said accessory access port.
4. A respiratory support system according to claim 2 wherein said distal end connector includes an adaptor formed of a generally hollow tubular member having a proximal end and a distal end, said proximal end of said adaptor being formed as part of said distal end connector and said distal end of said adaptor operating to open said normally closed access port valve to said open operative position when inserted into said accessory access port.
5. A respiratory support system according to claim 4 wherein said accessory access port further includes an injection fluid inlet opening therein and said adaptor includes an injection fluid opening therethrough, whereby, when said adaptor is positioned for operation in said accessory access port of said ventilator manifold, said injection fluid inlet opening is aligned with said injection fluid opening of said adaptor whereby, fluid can be injected through said injection fluid inlet opening and said injection fluid opening into said adaptor.
6. A respiratory support system according to claim 5 wherein said distal end connector further includes a locking device which operates in conjunction with said injection fluid inlet opening of said ventilator manifold to lock said adaptor in a single relative orientation with said accessory access port in which said injection fluid inlet opening of said accessory access port is aligned with said injection fluid opening of said adaptor.
