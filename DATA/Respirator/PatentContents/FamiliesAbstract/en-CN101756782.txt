The invention discloses a medical instrument which can replace mouth-to-mouth artificial respiration. The manual respirator comprises a rod, one end of the rod is provided with a plug, the plug slides in a bin, the other end of the rod is welded on a handle; a slice of an actuator is also welded on the handle and parallel to the rod (bin), a shaft in a cylindrical chamber is driven to rotate by the lower end of the slice, the plug moves from one end to the other end for inhaling air into the bin, the shaft closes an inlet valve and opens an air outlet, the plug returns back, the air is pressed into the lungs of the injured through a hose and a mouth-supporting mask covered on the nose and mouth, the plug moves towards the other end, the air is inhaled back into the bin, the shaft rotates again, the air is discharged out of the bin, so that the respiration is realized by the repeated operation ; if the shaft rotates first, i.e. the inlet valve is closed, and the air outlet is opened, the plug moves from one end to the other end again, and the foreign body blocked in the throat can be sucked out through the negative pressure in the bin. The manual respirator has the advantages of small size, low price and convenient carrying and promotion.
