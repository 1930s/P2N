<snippet>the prepn. of antidiarrhoeal substance (i) comprises: (1) enzymatic hydrolysis of a mixt. of powdered cereal and leguminous grains in an aq. medium, leading to at least partial decomposition of its carbohydrates and proteins into oligosaccharides, polypeptides and aminoacids; and (2) recovery from the hydrolysis medium of the mixt. obtd. in the form a dry powder by spray drying. more specifically, the cereal grain is oriza sativa (rice). the leguminous seed is phaseolus mungo (mung bean). the ratio of oriza sativa/phaseolus mungo in the starting mixt. is 1.8-2.2/1. hydrolysis pref. takes place in the presence of alpha-amylase. use - (i) is an antidiarrhoeal, having beneficial effects on intestinal activity, and partic. on sodium transport. an appropriate dosing regimen consists of two tablets contg. 1 g each of (i), taken every two or three hrs. according to the severity of diarrhoea
