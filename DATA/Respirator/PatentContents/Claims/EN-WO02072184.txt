Claims 1. A device for a respirator (1), which includes a pipe member (2) arranged to be introduced into the trachea of a patient and which is arranged to supply inhalation gas via the pipe member to the lungs of said patient during a first state and to discharge exhalation gas via the pipe member (2) from the lungs of said patient during a second state, wherein the device includes a first passage (5-7), which is arranged to connect the pipe member (2) to the respirator (1) and which at least is arranged to permit said discharge of the exhalation gas, a second passage (5,6,14), which extends between the pipe member (2) and a source (13) providing a subpressure, a third passage (4), which is arranged to connect the pipe member (2) to the respirator (1) and is arranged to permit said supply of inhalation gas, and a valve arrangement (20), which in an active position during a short period of time, is arranged to keep the second passage (5,6,14) open.
2. A device according to claim 1, characterised in that the valve arrangement (20), when the second passage (5,6,14) is open, is arranged to keep the first passage (5-7) closed.
3. A device according to any one of claims 1 and 2, characterised in that the valve arrangement (20), in an inactive normal position during a main part of the time of use of the device, is arranged to keep the second passage (5,6,14) closed.
4. A device according to any one of claims 1 to 3, characterised in that the valve arrangement (20) includes a first valve (21), which is provided between the pipe member (2) and said source (13) and which is arranged to be open in said active position.
5. A device according to claim 3 and 4, characterised in that the first valve (21) is arranged to be closed in said inactive normal position.
6. A device according to any one of claims 4 and 5, characterised in that said valve arrangement (20) includes a second valve (22), which is provided between the first valve (21) and said source (13) and which is arranged to be open in said active position.
7. A device according to claims 3 and 6, characterised in that said second valve (22) is arranged to be closed in said inactive normal position.
8. A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the valve arrangement (20) includes a third valve (23), which is provided between the pipe member (2) and the respirator (1) and which is arranged to be closed in said active position.
9. A device according to claims 3 and 6, characterised in that a third valve (23) is arranged to be open in said inactive normal position.
10. A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the device includes a control device (25) for controlling the valve arrangement (20).
11. A device according to claims 6,8 and 10, characterised in that the first valve (21), the second valve (22) and the third valve (23) are connected to the control device (25), which is arranged to control these valves (21-23).
12. A device according to any one of claims 10 and 11, characterised in that the control device (25) includes a first unit (26) for controlling the first valve (21) and a second unit (27) for controlling the second valve (22), wherein these units are substantially independent of each other.
13. A device according to any one of claims 10 to 12, characterised in that this control device (25) is connected to the respirator (1) for initiating the active position with respect to said state. 14. A device according to claim 13, characterised in that the control device (25) is arranged to initiate the active position substantially immediately after one of said first states.
15. A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the device includes a container (6) through which at least one of the first passage (5-7) and the second passage (5,6,14) extends for collecting liquid from said exhalation gas.
16. A device according to any one of the preceding claims, characterised in that the pipe member (2) includes a feeding pipe (8), which is connected to the third passage (4) and which has an outlet opening (9) arranged to be positioned in trachea during use of the device, and a discharge pipe (10), which is connected to the first passage (5-7) and the second passage (5,6,14) and which has an inlet opening (11) arranged to be positioned in trachea during use of the device.
17. A device according to claim 16, characterised in that said outlet opening is a distal outlet opening arranged to be positioned at the dividing region of the main bronchi of the patient during use of the device, and that said inlet opening is provided above said outlet opening.
18. A device according to claim 17, characterised in that the pipe member (2) includes a fixing member (3), which is arranged to be <RTI>introducable</RTI>  into the trachea and permit airtight fixing of the pipe member (2) in the trachea, wherein the fixing member (3) is arranged to be provided substantially immediately below the larynx of the patient and wherein the inlet opening (11) of the discharge pipe (10) is provided substantially immediately beneath the fixing member (3) and at a substantial distance from the outlet opening (9) of the feeding pipe (8).
19. A device according to claim 18, characterised in that the pipe member (2) includes a distance member (12), which is provided around the feeding pipe (8) between said inlet opening (11) and said outlet opening (9) and arranged to ensure that the feeding pipe (8) is located at a distance from at least one part of an inner wall of the trachea.
20 A device which includes a pipe member (2) arranged to be introduced into the trachea of a patient and which is arranged to supply inlet gas via the pipe member to the lungs of said patient during a first state and to discharge outlet gas via the pipe member (2) from the lungs of said patient during a second state, wherein the device includes an inlet passage (4), which is arranged to connect the pipe member (2) to a source (1) of inlet gas, an outlet passage (5,6,14), which extends between the pipe member (2) and a source (13) providing a sub-pressure, and a valve arrangement (20), which in an active position during a short period of time is arranged to keep the outlet passage (5,6,14) open, and wherein the pipe member includes a feeding pipe (8), which is connected to the inlet passage (4) and has an outlet opening arranged to be positioned in trachea during use of the device, and a discharge pipe (10), which is connected to the outlet passage (5,6, 14) and has an inlet opening arranged to be positioned in trachea during use of the device.
