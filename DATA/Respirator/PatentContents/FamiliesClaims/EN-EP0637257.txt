1. A respiratory support system (10) comprising: 
manifold means (11) having ports (12,13) adapted to be connected for fluid flow attachment between a patient and a ventilator circuit, and
a suction catheter device (41) comprising tubular connector means (40), a sleeve (52) attached to said connector means (40) and aligned with the through passage thereof, and a catheter (54) within said sleeve (52) and slidable through said connector means (40), said manifold means (11) further including an access port (15) for allowing attachment of said connector means (40) to said manifold means (11), said access port (15) being normally closed against fluid flow therethrough by a valve, in use attachment of said connector means (40) to said access port (15) operating to open said valve to allow fluid flow access between said manifold means (11) and said suction catheter (41), characterized in that said valve comprises a resilient disc (16) having a normally closed slit (20) therein, whereby during operation said connector means (40) opens said slit (20) and sealingly engages said disc (16) and in that said connector means (40) comprises a locking mechanism (44) to ensure secure attachment of the connector means (40) to said access port (15) to prevent inadvertent withdrawal thereof during use.
2. A system (10) according to claim 1 wherein said access port (15) further includes an injection fluid inlet (22) therein, and said connector means (40) has an injection fluid opening (69) to allow fluid flow access between said injection fluid inlet (22) and said manifold means (11) via said disc valve (16).
3. A system (10) according to claim 2 wherein said connector means (40) is tubular and said injection fluid opening (69) comprises an aperture in the wall thereof, said connector means (40) having alignment means (67,71) to ensure alignment of said injection fluid inlet (22) and said opening (69).
4. A system (10) according to any preceding claim wherein said locking mechanism (44) comprises a detent and stop type locking arrangement.
5. A system (10) according to claim 4, wherein said connector means (40) includes a window (55) for viewing said catheter (54) therethrough.
6. A system (10) according to claim 5 wherein said window (55) includes a lens (49) .
7. A system (10) according to any of claims 4-6 wherein said catheter includes a series of markings (61,62) along the length thereof.
8. A system (10) according to any preceding claim wherein a proximal end connector means (72) is adapted for fixed attachment to the proximal end of said catheter (54), for connecting said suction catheter device (41) to a suction control means (79); means (75) being provided for preventing fluid flow through said catheter (54) when said proximal end connector means (72) is not attached to the suction control means (79), and for allowing fluid flow through said catheter (54) when said proximal end connector means (72) is attached to the suction control means (79).
9. A system (10) according to claim 8 wherein said proximal end connector means (72) has an air flow passage (81) therethrough, said passage (81) allowing passage of air through said proximal end connector means (72) independent of said means (75) for preventing fluid flow through said catheter (54).
10. A system (10) according to claim 8 or claim 9 wherein said means (75) for preventing fluid flow comprises a slit septum.
11. A system (10) according to any of claims 8-10 wherein said catheter (54) has a second lumen (99) and said proximal end connector means (88) includes means (101) for injecting fluid therethrough into said second lumen (99).
12. A system (10) according to any preceding claim and further including a suction control valve (79) comprising a valve housing (109) having a suction source access port (119), a primary suction device access port (118) , and a fluid flow passage for allowing fluid flow between said suction source access port (119) and said primary suction device access port (118), 
movable actuator means (113) positioned at least partially within said valve housing (109) for movement relative thereto between at least a first position in which said primary suction device access port (119) is closed against fluid flow therethrough, and a second position in which said primary suction device access port (119) is open to fluid flow therethrough, and
auditory signal means (143, 144, 147) for indicating the location of said actuator means (113) between said first and said second positions.
13. A system (10) according to claim 12 wherein said suction control valve (79) further includes an ancillary suction device access port (158) in fluid flow connection with said fluid flow passage.
