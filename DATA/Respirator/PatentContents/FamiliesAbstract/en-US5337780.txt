A suction control valve is disclosed which includes a primary suction device access and an ancillary suction device access. The valve includes an actuator which is linearly movable between a first position in which the primary access is closed against suction pressure therethrough, to a second position in which the primary access is open to suction pressure therethrough. The valve also includes a rotatable valve core which can be rotated by the actuator to a third position to disable its linear movement and to open the ancillary access port. When the actuator is in the first position, atmospheric air can pass through the valve and into the suction pressure source in such a manner that a "hissing" auditory signal is generated, indicative of the presence of suction pressure within the valve. When the actuator is in the second or third positions, the "hissing" is prevented.
