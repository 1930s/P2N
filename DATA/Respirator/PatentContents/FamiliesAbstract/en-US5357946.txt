A ventilator manifold and adaptors therefore are disclosed which allow attachment of respiratory system accessory devices to the ventilator manifold without loss of PEEP. The manifold includes an accessory access port which has a normally closed valve therein which remains closed regardless of the pressure changes within the manifold. The normally closed valve is positioned in the accessory access port such that placement of an adaptor therein forces the normally closed valve to an open position, and removal of the adaptor allows the normally closed valve to return to its closed position. The adaptors are formed to allow attachment of accessory devices such as an ambulatory resuscitation bag, a metered dose inhaler, and a bronchial scope. The adaptors may also include a locking ring thereon for locking the adaptor in position in the accessory access port. Further, the manifold and adaptors may also be designed to allow the injection of fluid through the accessory access port into the manifold for cleaning or lavage.
